;;; Commentary:

;; Undo/redo convenience wrappers to Emacs default undo commands.
;;
;; The redo operation can be accessed from a key binding
;; and stops redoing once the initial undo action is reached.
;;
;; If you want to cross the initial undo step to access
;; the full history, pressing C-g (keyboard-quit)
;; lets you continue redoing for functionality not typically
;; accessible with regular undo/redo.
;;

;;; Usage

;; ;; Bind the keys
;; (global-unset-key (kbd "C-z"))
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-z")   'undo-fu-only-undo)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-S-z") 'undo-fu-only-redo)

;;; Code:

;; Internal variables.

;; First undo step in the chain, don't redo past this.
(defvar-local undo-fu--checkpoint nil)
;; We have reached the checkpoint, don't redo.
(defvar-local undo-fu--checkpoint-is-blocking nil)
;; Apply undo/redo constraints to stop redo from undoing or
;; passing the initial undo checkpoint.
